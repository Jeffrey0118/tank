      <p>
        This is a top-down game,There are two tanks in the game, one for the
        enemy and one for the player. In the course of the game, the player
        needs to avoid the enemy tanks and fire shells to destroy the enemy
        tanks in order to win.

    <div class="wrap">
      <p>
        1: Once you click into the game, keep your tank as far away from the
        enemy tank as possible so that you have more chances to destroy the
        other side with artillery shells.
      </p>
      <p>
        2: The enemy tank moves slower than the player tank and the bullets run
        slower, so you can use the gap between shell launches to fire shells at
        the enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
        3: Only one of the arrow keys can be pressed at the same time, pressing
        two arrow keys at the same time will only move in the direction of the
        first arrow key pressed by default
      </p>
      <p>
        4: As I've set the tank to only move up and down and left and right, the
        enemy tank isn't chasing the player very fast, but players still need to
        be aware that the tank can fire bullets!
